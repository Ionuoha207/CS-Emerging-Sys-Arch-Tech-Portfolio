# Project: Smart Thermostat Prototype

This project focused on developing a smart thermostat prototype using the TI CC3220x LAUNCHXL. It involved reading room temperature with the TMP006 sensor, controlling an LED to indicate heating status, and simulating data transmission to a server using UART. 

# Problem Solved:
The project addresses the need for a functional thermostat capable of monitoring room temperature and controlling heating systems, with the potential for cloud connectivity. 

# What I Did Well:
Successfully implemented precise temperature readings and responsive LED control.
Developed efficient button controls using GPIO interrupts for temperature adjustments.
Maintained clean, modular code adhering to best practices in embedded systems programming.

# Areas for Improvement:
Optimize the interrupt handling mechanism to enhance button press responsiveness.
Increase code efficiency in the task scheduler to boost overall performance.
Expand documentation to provide detailed explanations of complex functions.
